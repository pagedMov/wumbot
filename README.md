# wumbot
This is a discord bot I set up that will allow my friends some level of control over my personal server through discord

Current functionality:

-generates stream urls via interaction between the discord.py api and plexapi

-keeps track of user sessions to easily resume where the user left off

-basic controls for choosing episodes

planned features:

-starting and stopping video game servers

-some other stuff probably

Dependencies:

plexapi

discord.py

I'm currently only allowing me and my friends to use this, and I don't really plan on changing that. Each server the bot joins must be authenticated via the !password command so it's only usable if you get the password from me.
